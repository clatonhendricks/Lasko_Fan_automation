# Lasko Fan Automation

**Introduction**

This project was developed to automate my Lasko fan based on temperature threshold. If the temperature is greater than 76F then turn the fan ON & if its less than 75F turn if off. 

**Note**:- This was an outcome of the Microsoft Hackathon 2021 and I participated in the Microsoft Garage challenge to build something from IOT kit which was provided by the Garage team.

**The IOT kit**
1. Wio Terminal 
2. Temperature & Humidity grove module
3. Additional Battery chassis
