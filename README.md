# Lasko Fan Automation

**Introduction**

This project was created to automate my Lasko fan based on temperature threshold. If the temperature is greater than 76F then turn the fan On & if its less than 75F turn if off using infrared emitter. 

**Note**:- This is an outcome of the Microsoft Hackathon 2021 and I participated in the Microsoft Garage challenge to build something from IOT kit which was provided by the Garage team.

**The IOT kit**
1. Wio Terminal 
2. Temperature & Humidity grove module
3. Additional Battery chassis

**Library dependency**
1. IRLib - For infrared emitter
2. DHT - SEEED temp library
3. TFT_eSPI - LCD screen
4. Free_Fonts - font access
